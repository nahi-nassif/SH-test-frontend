# Project

SUPONO HOLDINGS STD Test.

## Run the frontend

For test purposes, I left the .env file to be visible in the git so you can directly run the server without the need to copy it.

To get started, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the server:

```bash
npm start
```
